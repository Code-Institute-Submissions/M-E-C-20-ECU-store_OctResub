# User Story and Feature Testing

The User Story testing was completed manually, each user story had an acceptance criteria defined, and a summary is provided as to how the acceptance criteria was met, and the outcome of each test. This section also encapsulates the manual testing of the features associated with the User Story Testing.

For checkout, Stripe is in test mode so real payments are not taken. For testing use the following: 
- card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- expiry: `04 / 24`
- CVC: `42424`
